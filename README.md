# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis with MLflow Tracking

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** using machine learning models while showcasing the power and flexibility of **MLflow** for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility. The aim is to build a robust NLP pipeline that can classify text as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, and use MLflow to track experiments, log models, and visualize performance metrics.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build a sentiment analysis pipeline using machine learning and/or deep learning models.
- Use **MLflow** to:
  - Track parameters, metrics, and artifacts across experiments.
  - Log models for reproducibility and deployment.
  - Compare different runs easily via the MLflow UI.
